    Summary:
    --------
    Pathways recommendation levels are currently defined by three buckets.
    These buckets are defined based on the number of impacted systems
    within an account out of the total number of systems within that account,
    then a combination of whether the pathway contains incidents,
    and the max aggregate risk for that pathway.

    The buckets are as follows:
    - Greater than 25% of systems in an account are impacted
    - Between 10% and 25% of systems in an account are impacted
    - Less than 10% of systems in an account are impacted

    Method:
    -------
    We use a basic scoring criteria based on each of the three factors.

    The numbers here are somewhat arbitrary, and in deference to Richard
    Brantley[1] I won't pretend to understand exactly where they came from.
    My best interpretation of them would be that a pathway having incidents
    scores two, the percentage of systems affected scores four, and the
    maximum risk scores twelve, and the top score is 100% so everything is
    scaled downward from there.

    The matrix of values for this is:

                  .   risk=4   .   risk=3   .   risk=2   .   risk=1   .
     incident? -> | True False | True False | True False | True False |
    --------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
    More than 25% | 100     98 |  88     86 |  76     74 |  64     62 |
    10% <-> 25%   | 96      94 |  84     82 |  72     70 |  60     58 |
    Less than 10% | 92      90 |  80     78 |  68     66 |  56     54 |
    --------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+

    [1] Richard implemented this as a Pandas DataFrame lookup; this made the
    algorithm slightly easier to follow but still didn't really describe how
    the individual weights of each factor were arrived at.

    An upload of a set of rule reports on a system, from processing that
    occurred on a particular date.  Customers are usually interested in the
    most recent upload of reports.

    An upload may contain no reports; it may contain different reports of
    different rules from those previous.

    There should only ever be one 'current' upload for a system from a source.
